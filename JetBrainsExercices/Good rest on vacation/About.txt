Write a program that will help people who are going on vacation.
The program should calculate the total required sum (e.g. $) of money to have a good rest for a given duration.

There are four parameters which have to be considered:

duration in days
total food cost per day
one-way flight cost
cost of one night in a hotel (the number of nights equal duration minus one)
Read values of these parameters from the standard input and then print the result.


Sample Input:
7 30 100 40

Sample Output:
650
